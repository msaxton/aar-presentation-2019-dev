# The AI Body Problem

This website contains materials relevant to our 2019 presentation for the Religion and AI Seminar at the AAR/SBL Annual Meeting in San Diego.

In addition to the homepage, this site comprises five elements, which can be accessed by clicking on the corresponding menu items listed above.  They are briefly summarized here for the purpose of orienting visitors.

### 1. [The Argument]({{ site.baseurl }}/argument.html)

Unease about artificial intelligence is often expressed in terms of the effects of bias, or job displacement, or the expectation of singularity (the fear that AI will displace humans as the dominant species on earth). Fears about AI almost always focus on AI's superior intelligence, because such a super intelligence will be beyond human control, and AI, in whatever form, will inevitably "outsmart" us and pursue its own ends.  Our thesis is that an unnamed source of uneasiness, which is masked by the terminology of "intelligence, is that humans experience AI as uncanny.  This pre-cognitive uncanniness, however, arises because AI is fundamentally familiar and unfamiliar at the same time; like us and unlike us it challenges our understanding of human nature and what it means to live a human life in relation to non-humans.

### 2. [Topic Model]({{ site.baseurl }}/topic-model.html)

In addition to the familiar academic modes of research and interpretation of text, we deployed unsupervised machine-learning as an experiment in using digital resources that are commonly regarded as simplified or proto forms of AI technology.  More specifically, we utilized topic-modeling to analyze selected Twentieth Century philosophical articles to test whether mind-body dualism is as stable and persistent an idea as we hypothesize.  The model we used is rudimentary, so it serves more as an illustrative instrument, than a conclusive one.  On this page we provide a visualization of our results as well as a link to the github page where our project resides and where you can find the code we wrote to create the topic model.

### 3. [GPT 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/topic-model.html)

GPT2, the much discussed brainchild of OpenAI, has been described has a form of language processing capable of finishing your sentences for you.  Here you will find a brief description of GPT 2 along with a link to a site where you can try it out for yourself.  We have not used GPT 2 in our research for this project.  We include this page as part of our presentation because it enables visitors to experience for themselves a machine capable of authoring its own text with only miniscule input from a user.  We hope its inclusion will inspire discussion about whether AI thinks for itself.   

### 4. [Bibliography]({{ site.baseurl }}/bibliography.html)

Here you will find a working bibliography, which we produced using Zotero.

### 5. [Conclusion]({{ site.baseurl }}/conclusion.html)

Here we offer very brief comments about where we think this line of inquiry will lead and questions we might pursue when we come together at AAR
